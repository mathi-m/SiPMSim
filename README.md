# SiPMSim

**This project is work in progress.**

SiPMSim is a behavioural simulator of Silicon Photomultiplier written in C++.
The simulator is work in progress and should be used later in the development of an detector system for Cherenkov light.

In this document I will provide a brief introduction to Silicon Photomultipliers, their design and properties.

The simulator will be described afterwards. 

## Silicon Photomultiplier

A Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) is a semiconductor device for detecting light. 

It offers a lot of advantages compared to previous technologies.
SiPM  
* offer single photon detection capability
* exhibit quasi binary response to a photon
* are working
  * at room temperature
  * at (relatively) low voltages (20-90 V)
  * in strong magnetic fields
  
  
## The Simulator

### Development

The simulator realizes (now) a simple algorithms for simulating the noise sources in a SiPM.
The first target is to realize a complete basic simulation algorithm, that serves as the basis for extending the concept.
